Challenges faced
1. Looking for an efficient logic i.e, formulas.
2. Working together for a solution while, not being able to meet physically. 
3. Testing for all possible wrong inputs producing errors.

Learnt from this assignment
1. Working on a same activity together.
2. Testing for possible errors in the program.
3. Writing an efficient code.
